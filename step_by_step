Create a new rails app:
	skipping test unit and using Postgress DB in the installation:
	rails new fit_right --skip-test-unit -d postgresql
	should see rails create a bunch of files & directories for you and then bundle install for you too. 

Start repo:
	Initialize a repository on your machine:  
		git init
		git add .
		git commit -m "first commit"
	Create a remote repo on github and sync them:
		Go create the repo on github
		git remote add origin https://github.com/kennytrionfo/taste_buds.git
		git push -u origin master

Start documentation: 
	Open app in text editor, 
	Edit readme file if u like, 
	Start step by step instructions file if you like. 

System check: 
	Check ur Rubies, versions and gems etc. i.e. rvm, ruby, rails, bundle, gems etc. 
	rvm list
	rvm gemset
	ruby -v
	rails -v

Install gems: 
	In Gemfile:
	Better Errors, factory girl, sprockets? 
	Minitest: 
	group :test, :development do
  	gem "minitest-rails"
	end
	Check for the minitest generator in console with: 
	rails generate
	Install the gem with this from the console:
